Ted, collaborating.
- load the tidyverse
- read in the kermit data as "kermit"
- make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the Gender column

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

```

```{r}

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```
